```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <h1>This is a gradient background</h1>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS to create a gradient background. However, if the `from-` and `to-` colors are too similar or use the same color, you may not see any gradient effect at all.  Another problem can arise if you misspell a class name or forget to include a required class.
