```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-red-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <h1>This is a gradient background</h1>
</div>
```
This corrected code uses distinct `from` and `to` colors (`blue-500` and `red-500`), ensuring a clear gradient effect.  This solution also includes careful review for typos in the class names.
